# Notedd

My present passion for mobile technologies has propelled me into a journey of self-learning, immersing myself in the development of a  music tracking and discussion platform, akin to a Letterboxd alternative. Inspired by Letterboxd's design principles and the extensive databases of platforms like RateYourMusic and Spotify, this project will allow me to delve into technologies such as Swift and React Native, along with mastering UI/UX design principles.

While apps like Musicboard already exist, I am driven by the belief that I can make something better â€“ a platform that not only understands but seamlessly incorporates the user flow and onboarding experience that makes apps like Spotify and Letterboxd so gratifying. Through attention to detail, I aim to create a music-centric app that offers a superior user experience.
